**Idea Behind the Collection:**

* **Leverage the Film's Popularity:** By tying the impact cards to a well-known and beloved movie like "Moana," we can tap into a wider audience and generate more interest.
* **Promote Environmental Awareness:** The collection can be used to educate users about the importance of ocean conservation, sustainable practices, and cultural preservation, all of which are themes explored in the film.
* **Create a Coherent Narrative:** Each impact card within the collection can be designed to represent a specific aspect of Moana's journey or the Polynesian culture, providing a cohesive and immersive experience.

**Example Impact Cards:**

* **"Wayfinder's Compass":** This card could represent the importance of navigation and exploration, while also highlighting the need for sustainable travel and resource management.
* **"Heart of Te Fiti":** This card could focus on the concept of restoring balance and harmony with nature, emphasizing the importance of protecting ecosystems and biodiversity.
* **"Maui's Transformation":** This card could explore the idea of personal growth and responsibility, encouraging users to make positive changes in their own lives to contribute to a healthier planet.

By creating a collection based on "Moana," we can offer users a unique and meaningful way to connect with the film's themes and take action to make a positive impact on the environment.
