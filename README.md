The Moana Collection is a curated set of impact cards inspired by the Disney movie "Moana." This collection aims to create a thematic and engaging experience for users while highlighting environmental themes relevant to the film.

**Idea Behind the Collection:**

* **Leverage the Film's Popularity:** By tying the impact cards to a well-known and beloved movie like "Moana," we can tap into a wider audience and generate more interest.
* **Promote Environmental Awareness:** The collection can be used to educate users about the importance of ocean conservation, sustainable practices, and cultural preservation, all of which are themes explored in the film.
* **Create a Coherent Narrative:** Each impact card within the collection can be designed to represent a specific aspect of Moana's journey or the Polynesian culture, providing a cohesive and immersive experience.

**Example Impact Cards**

* **"Gentle Giants of the Deep":** This card could highlight the importance of sustainable seafood choices to protect whale sharks, the biggest fish in the ocean.
* **"Ancient Navigators":** This card could focus on reducing plastic pollution and prevent oversfishing to keep sea turtles, ancient navigators of the sea, safe.
* **"Te Fiti's Tears":** This card could emphasize the impact of plastic pollution and the prevention of plastic consumption.
* **"Oceans Heart":** This card could inspire users to support organizations dedicated to reef conservation efforts, helping to bring back the magic of the reef.

By creating a collection based on "Moana," we can offer users a unique and meaningful way to connect with the film's themes and take action to make a positive impact on the environment.
